# Anvil README Example

This repo contains an example README file you can use to help you write the instructions you need to help your teachers and WJEC moderators access your A-Level Unit 5 Coursework.

[Get the example README here](./exampleReadme.md)

## Important Notes

 - You **must* test that your instructions actually work. If they don't work, your teachers and moderators won't be able to access and test your working code.
 - You need to have set up GitLab and pushed your code to it before updating the README file. Check Google Classroom for instructions on this.
